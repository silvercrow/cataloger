The web application was done with NodeJS as the platform, ExpressJS as the framework and MongoDB as NOSQL database.
To run this example, you need:

 1. have nodejs and mongodb
 2. run "npm install" in the root folder of the web application to install all the dependencies
 3. run "mongod --dbpath /your/path/"
 4. finally, run "node app.js"
 5. the app can be accessed via: localhost:3000
Thank you!
